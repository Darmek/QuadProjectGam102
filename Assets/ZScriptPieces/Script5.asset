  - 'Arana: Father! What is going on here?! I didn''t want to believe this...'
  - 'Father: Arana? What are you doing down here? Go back upstairs this instant.'
  - 'Arana: Not until you tell me what''s going on! I thought we accepted everyone
    inside these walls!'
  - 'Father: Arana dear, you can''t expect us to accept everyone... These people are
    just tools for us to learn from.'
  - Arana clutches her mouth as she see's the man on the table
  - 'Vi: See Arana, I told you this is the harsh reality you live in. You family culls
    and experiments on people like me.'
  - 'Father: LIES! Arana do not listen to her! GUARDS! Where are my guards?!'
  - Vi laughs, and your father reels away
  - 'Vi: Your guards won''t be coming. And you will pay for the things you have done.'
  - Vi stabs her blade into your father, he keels over on the floor clutching his
    stomache. His hand reaches out to you
  - 'Father: A-Arana...'
  - 'Vi: Arana theres countless others just like your father. I''m sorry you had to
    go through this but now you have an option.'
  - 'Vi: You can either live your life out here in your fathers collapsing empire,
    Or come and join me and the rebellion.'
