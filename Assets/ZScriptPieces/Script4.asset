  - 'Arana: Guards! Theres is an Intru-'
  - 'Intruder: Shusshh. No noises, we wouldn''t want you to get hurt would we?'
  - The intruder turns a knife over in her hands
  - 'Intruder: My name is Vi, and you''re going to listen to what i have to say, I
    don''t think either of us want anyone to get hurt.'
  - You nod your head
  - 'Vi: Life is a little... different outside the walls, you know? Your family and
    their followers throw their trash into our homes. We have to scavenge it just
    to live.'
  - 'Arana: That''s simply not true! Father has taught me-'
  - Vi presses the blade up to your lips and bursts into laughter
  - 'Vi: Hahaha! They''re feeding you lies! Your family isn''t as kind and noble as
    they''ve led you to believe.'
  - 'Arana: But... that doesn''t make any sense...'
  - 'Vi: Few things ever do. But I''m not here to teach you, I''m going to have you
    take me to your dungeon in the mansion.'
  - 'Arana: What? A dungeon? Our home doesn''t have something like that.'
  - 'Vi: Of course it does. Your family has been keeping some dark dark secrets from
    you. Why not snoop around a little bit and see what you can find...'
  - 'Vi: I''ll meet you in the dungeon.'
